# Specification Quality Checklist: Real Ledger Flex Signing

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validated 2026-06-14: all items pass. Recommended defaults recorded as
  Assumptions (raw-hex signing first / Clear Signing deferred; Ledger-standard ETH
  path; approver = device address; Chromium + Flex with Ethereum app; simulator
  fallback) — no NEEDS CLARIFICATION.
- Kept device-agnostic at the requirement level ("the device", "secure element").
  Concrete DMK packages, the WebHID transport, and `signTypedData` → {r,s,v} → hex
  assembly are `/speckit-plan` concerns, governed by `.agents/skills/`. DX-NOTES.md
  (Principle VII) begins in this slice.
